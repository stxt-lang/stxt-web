	Header: Use cases — Wikipedia (an alternative approach)
	
	Content >>
		This section does not propose replacing Wikipedia or its ecosystem.
		It is a design exercise: how encyclopedic content could be represented
		with a **Human-First** format and, at the same time, structured and validatable.
		
		The idea is to show an alternative approach for:
		* collaborative editorial content,
		* with sections and references,
		* and with fragments that are “data” (fact boxes, links, categories).
		
	Subheader: What a Wikipedia-type page needs
	
	Content >>
		An encyclopedic page usually has:
		
		* Title and metadata.
		* Opening summary (lead).
		* Hierarchical sections.
		* Internal and external links.
		* References (citations).
		* Categories.
		* Sometimes an “infobox” with structured data.
		
		@STXT@ allows modeling all of that as:
		
		* free text in `>>` blocks where reading matters,
		* explicit structure where the tree matters,
		* and optional validation if consistency is desired.
		
	Subheader: Example 1 — Minimal page
	
	Content >>
		A very small page, with a summary and one section.
		
	Code >>
		Page (@com.example.wiki):
			Title: STXT
			Lead >>
				STXT (Semantic Text) is a hierarchical textual format designed
				to be human-readable and reliable for machines.
				
			Sections:
				Section:
					Heading: Description
					Content >>
						STXT uses indentation to define hierarchy and offers
						literal `>>` blocks for multiline text.
						
			Categories:
				Category: Data formats
				Category: Markup languages
	
	Subheader: Example 2 — Nested sections
	
	Content >>
		In Wikipedia it is very common to have sections and subsections.
		In STXT that is a natural tree.
		
	Code >>
		Page (@com.example.wiki):
			Title: Markup languages
			
			Lead >>
				A markup language is a system for annotating a document
				so that its structure is distinguishable from the content.
			
			Sections:
				Section:
					Heading: History
					Content >>
						Markup languages have evolved from systems
						for printing to structured formats for the web.
					
					Subsections:
						Section:
							Heading: SGML
							Content >>
								SGML was an important standard for describing structured documents.
								
						Section:
							Heading: HTML
							Content >>
								HTML became popular with the World Wide Web as a format for hypertext.
				
				Section:
					Heading: Uses
					Content >>
						They are used for technical documentation, publications, and web content.
	
	Subheader: Example 3 — Internal and external links
	
	Content >>
		In Wikipedia there are “internal” links (to other pages) and external links.
		In STXT they can be expressed as explicit nodes, without “inventing” syntax inside the text.
		
	Code >>
		Page (@com.example.wiki):
			Title: STXT
			
			Lead >>
				STXT can be compared with other formats such as JSON and YAML.
			
			Links:
				Internal:
					Link:
						Title: JSON
						Page: JSON
					Link:
						Title: YAML
						Page: YAML
				External:
					Link:
						Title: Example repository
						Url: https://example.com/stxt
						
			Sections:
				Section:
					Heading: Comparison
					Content >>
						See also the related formats listed in the links section.
	
	Subheader: Example 4 — References and citations
	
	Content >>
		A typical pattern in encyclopedias is:
		
		* the text mentions something,
		* a reference supports it,
		* the reference appears in a list.
		
		A clear way in STXT is to separate:
		
		* references as a processable block,
		* and citation “markers” within the text as something optional (for example `[ref: ...]`).
		
	Code >>
		Page (@com.example.wiki):
			Title: Indentation
			
			Lead >>
				Indentation is used in different languages to express structure. [ref: r1]
				
			Sections:
				Section:
					Heading: Use in textual formats
					Content >>
						Some formats rely on indentation to represent hierarchy. [ref: r1]
						Others use it only as a visual style.
			
			References:
				Reference:
					Id: r1
					Title: Indentation style guide (example)
					Author: Example Org
					Year: 2024
					Url: https://example.com/indentation
	
	Subheader: Example 5 — References with an editorial “note”
	
	Content >>
		Sometimes a reference needs context: why it is used or what it limits.
		Since it is human text, it fits well in a `>>` block.
		
	Code >>
		Page (@com.example.wiki):
			Title: Structured data
			
			Lead >>
				Infoboxes help summarize key information. [ref: r2]
			
			References:
				Reference:
					Id: r2
					Title: Structured data overview (example)
					Url: https://example.com/structured-data
					Note >>
						Reference used only as an example of how to attach editorial notes
						to a source. In a real system, this would come from a references catalog.
	
	Subheader: Example 6 — Categories and maintenance
	
	Content >>
		Wikipedia handles categories, maintenance templates, and “community metadata”.
		In STXT they can be represented as metadata sections, separated from the main content.
		
	Code >>
		Page (@com.example.wiki):
			Title: Free software
			
			Lead >>
				Free software is software that respects users' freedom.
			
			Sections:
				Section:
					Heading: Definition
					Content >>
						It is often associated with licenses that allow use, study, modification, and distribution.
			
			Categories:
				Category: Software
				Category: Licenses
			
			Maintenance:
				Needs citations: true
				Last reviewed: 2025-11-01
				Notes >>
					Marked for review because references are missing in the history section.
	
	Subheader: Example 7 — “Infobox” as real data
	
	Content >>
		An infobox is basically an object with fields.
		In STXT it is represented as a subtree with clear names.
		
	Code >>
		Page (@com.example.wiki):
			Title: Tomcat
			
			Infobox:
				Type: Software
				Name: Apache Tomcat
				Initial release: 1999
				License: Apache License 2.0
				Website: https://tomcat.apache.org
				Written in: Java
			
			Lead >>
				Apache Tomcat is a web container and HTTP server for Java applications.
			
			Sections:
				Section:
					Heading: Description
					Content >>
						It implements specifications such as Servlet and JavaServer Pages (JSP).
	
	Subheader: Example 8 — Infobox with lists and repeated values
	
	Content >>
		Real infoboxes often have lists (for example, “authors” or “languages”).
		With STXT, repetitions are natural.
		
	Code >>
		Page (@com.example.wiki):
			Title: Python
			
			Infobox:
				Type: Programming language
				Name: Python
				Designed by:
					Person: Guido van Rossum
				First appeared: 1991
				Paradigms:
					Paradigm: Object-oriented
					Paradigm: Imperative
					Paradigm: Functional
				Typing discipline:
					Item: Dynamic
					Item: Strong
			
			Lead >>
				Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language.
	
	Subheader: Example 9 — Templates as reusable “blocks”
	
	Content >>
		Wikipedia uses templates to reuse fragments (notices, boxes, etc.).
		In STXT, a “template” could be a structured node that the renderer interprets.
		
	Code >>
		Page (@com.example.wiki):
			Title: Solar energy
			
			Lead >>
				Solar energy is the energy obtained from the Sun's radiation.
			
			Boxes:
				Box:
					Type: notice
					Title: Article in development
					Content >>
						This article is an example. The history section is incomplete.
						
				Box:
					Type: see-also
					Title: See also
					Items:
						Item:
							Title: Wind energy
							Page: Wind energy
						Item:
							Title: Hydroelectric energy
							Page: Hydroelectric energy
	
	Subheader: Example 10 — Content variants without breaking the tree
	
	Content >>
		A typical challenge in a wiki is mixing:
		
		* a table,
		* a code block,
		* and normal text,
		
		without the format “fighting” with the structure.
		In STXT, the direct way is to use `>>` blocks for literal content.
		
	Code >>
		Page (@com.example.wiki):
			Title: TCP ports
			
			Lead >>
				TCP ports are used to identify services on a machine.
			
			Sections:
				Section:
					Heading: Well-known ports
					Content >>
						Simple table (literal text):
						
						Port | Service
						80   | HTTP
						443  | HTTPS
						22   | SSH
						
				Section:
					Heading: Configuration example
					Content >>
						Example (literal text):
						
						Server:
							Port: 8080
							Host: 0.0.0.0
	
	Subheader: Example 11 — Article with editorial “versioning”
	
	Content >>
		Without assuming a specific system, editorial metadata can be included
		for auditing or change control.
		
	Code >>

	Subheader: Example 12 — Minimal template for wiki pages
	
	Content >>
		If consistency is desired, it can be validated with a simple template.
		It does not force the “Wikipedia form”, it only defines a basic skeleton.
