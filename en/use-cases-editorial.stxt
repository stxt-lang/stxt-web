	Header: Use cases — Publications and editorial content
	
	Content >>
		Editorial systems live in a constant tension between:
		
		* **rich, narrative content** (long text, sections, context),
		* **structure** (chapters, metadata, relationships),
		* **and data** (status, dates, authors, tags).
		
	Assert >>
		@STXT@ makes it possible to treat a publication as **a human document first**,
		without losing the ability to validate, transform, and automate.
		
	Subheader: What we mean by “publications”
	
	Content >>
		In this context, “publication” includes:
		
		* Articles and long posts.
		* Books and chapters.
		* Technical documentation.
		* Public reports.
		* Whitepapers.
		* Corporate or technical blogs.
		
	Subheader: Common problems in editorial workflows
	
	Content >>
		In practice, repeated patterns appear:
		
		* Markdown:
		  * Flexible, but poor in semantics.
		  * Ad-hoc metadata (YAML front-matter).
		  * Hard to validate structure.
		
		* Traditional CMS:
		  * Rigid models.
		  * Editing coupled to a specific tool.
		  * Difficult to version in Git.
		
		* Editorial XML:
		  * Very powerful.
		  * Too verbose for manual editing.
		
		@STXT@ proposes another path:
		
		* A single format for text, structure, and data.
		* Clear separation between **content** and **rules**.
		* Editing with any text editor.

		Article (@com.acme.editorial.article):
			Title: Introduction to STXT
			Slug: introduction-to-stxt
			Authors:
				Author:
					Name: Joan Costa
					Role: Editor
			Published date: 2026-01-10
			Status: Draft
			Tags:
				Tag: stxt
				Tag: formats
				Tag: documentation
			
			Abstract >>
				STXT is a textual language designed to balance
				human readability and reliability for machines.
				
			Content >>
				## Why another format?
				
				Most existing formats force a choice:
				either they are comfortable for humans or they are reliable for machines.
				
				STXT tries to eliminate this dichotomy.
				
				## Principles
				
				- Human First
				- Minimal syntax
				- Optional validation
				- Security by design
	
	Subheader: Observations from the example
	
	Content >>
		* Long text lives in `>>` blocks.
		* The editorial structure (title, authors, status) is explicit.
		* The content can contain Markdown without interfering with STXT.
		
	Subheader: Example 2 — Multi-section publication
	
	Content >>
		Book or long document divided into sections.

	Subheader: Typical editorial workflow with @STXT@
	
	Content >>
		A common workflow can be:
		
		1. The author writes the STXT document.
		2. It is versioned in Git.
		3. A template validates minimal structure.
		4. It is transformed to HTML, PDF, or other formats.
		5. It is published.
		
		Each step is independent and replaceable.
		
	Subheader: Validation with @stxt.template
	
	Content >>
		An editorial template ensures consistency without imposing rigidity.
		
	Code >>

							Role: (?)
					Published date: (?) DATE
					Status: (1) ENUM [Draft, Review, Published]
					Tags: (?)

		This template:
		
		* Guarantees minimal metadata.
		* Controls editorial status.
		* Allows free text without artificial restrictions.
		
	Subheader: Content / presentation separation
	
	Content >>
		With STXT:
		
		* The document **does not know** HTML, CSS, or layout.
		* Presentation is decided in a later phase.
		* The same content can be rendered in multiple ways.
		
		Examples:
		
		* Web
		* PDF
		* EPUB
		* Internal documentation
		
	Subheader: Practical advantages
	
	Content >>
		* **Comfortable authorship**: write without fighting tags.
		* **Clean diffs**: clear textual changes in version control.
		* **Lightweight validation**: prevents incomplete articles.
		* **Automation**: indexes, tables of contents, feeds.
		* **Longevity**: content survives specific tools.
		
	Subheader: Editorial recommendations
	
	Content >>
		* Use `TEXT` for body and long sections.
		* Keep metadata concise and stable.
		* Avoid coupling content to output formats.
		* Use templates to guide, not to limit.
		
	Subheader: Summary
	
	Content >>
		@STXT@ is especially suitable for editorial publishing:
		
		* Text remains text.
		* Structure is explicit.
		* Validation is optional.
		* Content can evolve without changing format.
