	Header: @STXT@ Tutorial
	
	Subheader: 1. What is @STXT@?
	
	Content >>
		**@STXT@ (Semantic Text)** is a hierarchical and semantic textual language,
		designed to be **Human-First**:
		
		* Easy to read and write by people.
		* Trivial to parse by machines.
		* Secure by design.
		
		@STXT@ allows representing structured documents through:
		
		* **Inline nodes** (`:`) for simple values.
		* **Literal text blocks** (`>>`) for multiline content.
		* **Indentation** to express hierarchy.
		* **Namespaces** to separate semantics and allow external validation.
		
		The base syntax is minimal. Advanced semantics are added through:
		
		* `@stxt.schema` — formal and exhaustive validation.
		* `@stxt.template` — simplified and prototype-oriented validation.
		
	Subheader: 2. Basic example: a book record
	
	Content >>
		Let’s look at a simple example of an @STXT@ document that describes a book.
		There is no validation yet: it is only @STXT@ language. Also, it has
		no associated namespace.
		
	Code >>
		Book:
			Title: Modern software architecture
			Authors:
				Author: María Pérez
				Author: Juan García
			ISBN: 978-84-123456-7-8
			Publisher: ACME Publishing
			Published: 2025-10-01
			Summary >>
				This book offers a practical view of patterns and best practices
				for designing distributed and scalable systems.
			Chapter: Introduction to architecture
				Content >>
					In this chapter we present basic concepts:
					monoliths, microservices, and design criteria.
			Chapter: Communication between services
				Content >>
					Protocols, messaging, and integration patterns are described.
	Content >>
		Observations:
		
		* The hierarchy is defined **only by indentation**.
		* `Summary >>` and `Content >>` are literal text blocks: their content is not interpreted as @STXT@.
		* There is no implicit type: everything is text unless it is validated.
		
	Subheader: 3. Using namespaces
	
	Assert >>
		Namespaces allow grouping nodes into categories. Also, if a namespace is defined
		for a node, **child nodes inherit the parent’s namespace**, unless one of them
		redefines it.
		
	Content >>
		Example of a document with a namespace:
		
	Code >>
		Book ***(com.acme.book)***:
			Title: Modern software architecture
			Authors:
				Author: María Pérez
				Author: Juan García
			ISBN: 978-84-123456-7-8
	
	Content >>
		In this example we see the `Book` node that belongs to the `com.acme.book` namespace.
		In addition, we also see nodes `Title`, `Authors`, `Author`, and `ISBN`, which, being
		descendants of `Book`, also inherit the `com.acme.book` namespace.
		
		Key rules:
		
		* The namespace is inherited by child nodes.
		* A node can redefine its namespace if necessary.
		* The @STXT@ language **does not validate** the namespace; it only defines the
		  propagation rules.
		
	Subsubheader: 3.1 Special namespaces with `@`
	Content >>
		Namespaces may or may not start with `@`. This indicates that they are
		**special or reserved namespaces**. For example, both templates
		and schemas start with `@`.
		
		This is only a semantic indication, but the behavior is the same.
	
	Subsubheader: 3.2 Document validation
	
	Content >>
		To be able to semantically validate a document, it must be associated with a **namespace**.
		Once it has the namespace, a schema (`@stxt.schema`)
		or template (`@stxt.template`) is used to validate it. Validations are extensions
		to the base language, which parsers may or may not implement.
		
	Assert >>
		To validate a document **it is necessary that it belongs to a namespace**.\\
		On the other hand, a document with a namespace is not required to be validated.
			
	Subheader: 4. Validation with Templates
	
	Content >>
		**Templates** allow defining structural and type rules
		in a compact way. They are ideal for prototypes and living documentation.
		
		A template is an @STXT@ document whose namespace is `@stxt.template`.
		
	Subsubheader: 4.1 Template for books
	
	Code >>
		Template (@stxt.template): com.acme.book
			Description: Template for publishing book records
			Structure >>
				Book:
					Title: (1)
					Authors: (1)
						Author: (+)
					ISBN: (1)
					Publisher: (?)
					Published: (?) DATE
					Summary: (?) TEXT
					Chapter: (+)
						Content: (?) TEXT
							
	Content >>
		What this template defines:
		
		* `Book` is the expected root node.
		* `Title`, `ISBN`, and `Authors` are required (`(1)`).
		* `Author` can repeat and there must be at least one (`(+)`).
		* `Published` must have `DATE` format.
		* `Summary` and `Content` are text blocks (`TEXT`).
		* There must be at least one `Chapter`.
		
	Subsubheader: 4.2 Applying the template
	
	Content >>
		A validator that supports templates must:
		
		* Verify that the nodes exist.
		* Check cardinalities.
		* Validate basic types (number, date, boolean, text).
		
		The @STXT@ language **does not change**: the template is applied over the already-parsed tree.
		Depending on the parser, it may validate at the same time it parses the content.
		
	Subheader: 5. Validation with Schemas
	
	Content >>
		**Schemas** provide the same information as a template,
		but in a more explicit and formal way.
		
		A schema:
		
		* Is an @STXT@ document with namespace `@stxt.schema`.
		* Defines nodes, types, and cardinalities separately.
		* Is the “canonical” representation of validation.
		
	Subsubheader: 5.1 Schema equivalent to the template
	
	Code >>

	Content >>
		* The schema is more verbose, but more explicit.
		* A template can be automatically compiled into this form.
		* A validator **SHOULD** prioritize schema over template if both exist.

					Basic concepts and objectives of the book.
						
	Content >>
		This document:
		
		* Is valid @STXT@.
		* Complies with the `com.acme.book` template.
		* Complies with the `com.acme.book` schema.
		
	Subheader: 7. Best practices
	
	Content >>
		* Use `>>` blocks for long or literal text.
		* Keep indentation consistent (use spaces or tabs, but do not mix them).
		* Use templates to iterate quickly or to have a view as close as possible to what the documents are like.
		* Use schemas when a more formal description of the fields is needed
