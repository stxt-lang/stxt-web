	Header: CMS (Content Management Systems)

	Content >>
		Traditional CMSs often mix too many responsibilities:
		
		* data model,
		* editing interface,
		* validation rules,
		* and final presentation.

	Assert >>		
		@STXT@ proposes separating these layers, using a **documental format**
		that is stable, readable, and reusable outside of any specific tool.
		
	Subheader: What we mean by CMS
	
	Content >>
		In this context, a CMS is:
		
		* A system that manages structured content.
		* With human editing.
		* With multiple outputs (web, feeds, APIs).
		* With versioning and review.
		
		Examples:
		
		* Corporate websites.
		* Blogs and content portals.
		* Living documentation.
		* Catalogs and product sheets.
		
	Subheader: Common problems in classic CMSs
	
	Content >>
		Common patterns:
		
		* Rigid models that are hard to evolve.
		* Editing coupled to a specific UI.
		* Difficulty versioning and reviewing changes.
		* Limited or proprietary exports.
		* Strong dependency on the database.
		
		Over time, the content becomes “trapped”.
		
	Subheader: @STXT@ approach for CMS
	
	Content >>
		@STXT@ fits as the **source format** of the content:
		
		* The CMS does not define the document format.
		* The CMS interprets STXT and provides tools around it.
		* The content lives in files, not in the tool.
		
		This enables:
		
		* Decoupled CMS.
		* Portable content.
		* Interchangeable renderers.
		
	Subheader: Example 1 — Web page
	
	Content >>
		Typical page with metadata, sections, and free-form content.
		
	Code >>
		Page (@com.acme.cms.page):

	Subheader: Example 2 — Reusable components
	
	Content >>
		A CMS usually works with blocks or components.
		
	Code >>
		Page (@com.acme.cms.page):
			Title: Home
			Slug: index
			
			Blocks:
				Block:
					Type: hero
					Title: STXT
					Subtitle: Built for humans. Reliable for machines.
				Block:
					Type: features
					Items:
						Item: Readable
						Item: Safe
						Item: Validatable
				Block:
					Type: call-to-action
					Label: Read the tutorial
					Target: /lang-tutorial
	
	Subheader: Key advantage: visible structure
	
	Content >>
		* An editor sees the structure without a graphical interface.
		* A developer can map blocks easily.
		* A renderer can transform each `Block` according to its `Type`.
		
	Subheader: Validation with @stxt.template
	
	Content >>
		A template prevents incomplete or inconsistent pages.
		
	Code >>
		Template (@stxt.template): com.acme.cms.page
			Description: Standard CMS page
			Structure >>
				Page:
					Title: (1)
					Slug: (1)
					Language: (?) ENUM [es, en, fr]
					Status: (1) ENUM [Draft, Published, Archived]
					Layout: (?)
					
					SEO: (?)
						Title: (?)
						Description: (?)
						Keywords: (?)
							Keyword: (+)
					
					Header: (?) TEXT
					Content: (1) TEXT
					Footer: (?) TEXT
					
					Blocks: (?)
						Block: (*)
							Type: (1)
	
	Content >>
		This template:
		
		* Ensures title, slug, and content.
		* Controls editorial states.
		* Allows flexible blocks.
		
	Subheader: “Headless” CMS and STXT
	
	Content >>
		In a headless CMS:
		
		* STXT is the source of the content.
		* The CMS exposes an API (JSON, GraphQL).
		* The front end consumes transformed data.
		
		STXT fits well because:
		
		* The parser produces a neutral tree.
		* Transformations are explicit.
		* The content does not depend on the front end.
		
	Subheader: Versioning and review
	
	Content >>
		* Each change is a clear textual diff.
		* Reviews can be done in Git.
		* There is no hidden state in a database.
		
	Subheader: Recommendations for CMS
	
	Content >>
		* Define a few clear document types.
		* Use templates for each type.
		* Keep blocks simple and well named.
		* Avoid conditional logic in the content.
		* Keep presentation out of the document.
		
	Subheader: Summary
	
	Content >>
		@STXT@ as the basis of a CMS enables:
		
		* Portable content.
		* Clear structure.
		* Optional validation.
		* Independence from tools and frameworks.
