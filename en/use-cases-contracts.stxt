	Header: Contracts and legal agreements
	
	Content >>
		This section **is not intended to replace** formal legal documents,
		nor existing legal processes.
		
		The goal is to show how @STXT@ can be used as a
		**readable and structured source format** for contracts, agreements,
		and regulatory documents that:
		
		* must be read and understood by people,
		* contain rules, conditions, and exceptions,
		* and often coexist with technical or operational processes.
		
	Subheader: What types of documents
	
	Content >>
		In this context, we are talking about:
		
		* Service provision contracts.
		* Master agreements.
		* SLAs (Service Level Agreements).
		* NDAs (confidentiality agreements).
		* Terms and conditions.
		* Internal policies and corporate regulations.
		
		Many of these documents:
		
		* start out as “legal text”,
		* but end up having a direct impact on operations, systems, or people.
		
	Subheader: Common problems in legal documents
	
	Content >>
		In practice:
		
		* The text is long and dense.
		* Important conditions are “buried” in paragraphs.
		* Key data (dates, parties, amounts, deadlines) are not easily extractable.
		* Versioning changes is complex (PDFs, Word).
		* There is no clear separation between:
		  * regulatory content,
		  * contractual data,
		  * and explanatory context.
		
		@STXT@ does not eliminate legal complexity,
		but it **organizes the document**.
		
	Subheader: Example 1 — Simple agreement
	
	Content >>
		A basic agreement between two parties, with legal text and explicit data.
		
	Code >>
		Agreement (@com.acme.legal.contract):
			Id: AGR-2026-001
			Title: Service provision agreement
			Status: Draft
			Effective date: 2026-02-01
			
			Parties:
				Party:
					Name: ACME Corp
					Role: Provider
				Party:
					Name: Example Ltd
					Role: Client
			
			Purpose >>
				This agreement governs the provision of technical support services
				between the parties.
			
			Term:

				End: 2027-01-31
			
			Payment:
				Fee: 12000
				Currency: EUR
				Billing period: Monthly
			
			Governing law: ES
	
	Subheader: What you gain with this structure
	
	Content >>
		* The parties and dates are clear data.
		* The legal text remains text, without “chopping it up”.
		* The document is readable without technical knowledge.
		
	Subheader: Example 2 — Clauses as explicit sections
	
	Content >>
		Clauses are a natural tree.
		
	Code >>
		Agreement (@com.acme.legal.contract):
			Id: AGR-2026-002
			Title: Confidentiality agreement
			
			Clauses:
				Clause:
					Number: 1
					Title: Definition of confidential information
					Text >>

						non-public information disclosed by either party.

						information to third parties without prior consent.
						
				Clause:
					Number: 3
					Title: Exceptions
					Text >>
						Information that is
						in the public domain or required by law shall not be considered confidential.
	
	Subheader: Example 3 — SLA (service level agreement)
	
	Content >>
		An SLA mixes regulatory text with concrete metrics.
		
	Code >>
		SLA (@com.acme.legal.sla):
			Service: Payments platform
			Effective date: 2026-03-01
			
			Availability:
				Target percentage: 99.9
				Measurement period: Monthly
			
			Response times:
				Severity:
					Level: Critical
					Max response minutes: 30
				Severity:
					Level: High
					Max response minutes: 120
			
			Penalties:
				Penalty:
					Condition >>
						Availability below the monthly target.
					Consequence >>
						10% discount on the monthly invoice.
			
			Legal text >>
				The metrics will be measured in accordance with the procedures
				described in the technical annex.
	
	Subheader: Example 4 — Exceptions and conditions
	
	Content >>
		Contracts often have rules with exceptions.
		
	Code >>
		Clause:
			Title: Limitation of liability
			Rule >>
				Total liability shall not exceed the annual amount of the contract.
			
			Exceptions:
				Exception >>
					Such limitation shall not apply in cases of willful misconduct or gross negligence.
	
	Subheader: Example 5 — History and versions
	
	Content >>
		Agreements evolve: amendments, renewals, revisions.
		
	Code >>
		Agreement (@com.acme.legal.contract):
			Id: AGR-2026-003
			Title: Master agreement
			
			History:
				Revision:
					Date: 2026-01-15
					Summary: Initial version
				Revision:
					Date: 2026-03-10
					Summary: Update to payment clauses
			
			Current version: 2
	
	Subheader: Example 6 — Legal comments and internal notes
	
	Content >>
		It is common to separate:
		
		* contractual text,
		* internal notes,
		* and legal observations.
		
	Code >>
		Clause:
			Title: Jurisdiction
			
			Text >>
				The parties submit to the courts of Madrid.
			
			Internal notes >>
				Standard clause approved by legal.
				Do not modify without legal review.
	
	Subheader: Example 7 — Minimal template for agreements
	
	Content >>
		A template can ensure that an agreement has
		the essential elements, without imposing legal drafting.
		
	Code >>
		Template (@stxt.template): com.acme.legal.contract
			Description: Basic contract structure
			Structure >>
				Agreement:
					Id: (1)
					Title: (1)
					Status: (1) ENUM [Draft, Signed, Terminated]
					Effective date: (?)
					
					Parties: (1)
						Party: (+)
							Name: (1)
							Role: (1)

	Subheader: Why this approach is useful
	
	Content >>
		Using STXT as a source format for contracts allows:
		
		* Documents readable without special tools.
		* Clear structure for human review.
		* Automatic extraction of key data.
		* Versioning and auditing via version control.
		
		Without turning the contract into code
		or imposing an artificial formal language.
		
	Subheader: Summary
	
	Content >>
		Contracts and legal agreements are, in essence:
		
		* regulatory text,
		* with repeatable structure,
		* and critical data.
		
		@STXT@ makes it possible to represent them clearly,
		readably, and in a structured way,
		respecting their human and legal nature.
